Extracted Code Snippets from Professional Crystal Programming
Overview

This collection contains all code-like snippets extracted from the book Professional Crystal Programming. The snippets were detected automatically using heuristics for Crystal language syntax, as well as related tools (YAML configs, Dockerfiles, shell commands, SQL, etc.). Each snippet is grouped by chapter.

The purpose of this archive is to give you quick access to every example without needing to manually scan through the text.

Structure

Chapter_XX/
Each chapter of the book has its own folder.
Example: Chapter_01/, Chapter_02/…

Files inside each folder
Snippets are named sequentially as they appear:

snippet_001.cr → Crystal source code

snippet_002.yml → YAML/CI configuration

Dockerfile_003 → Dockerfile example

snippet_004.sh → Shell script

snippet_005.sql → SQL snippet

snippet_006.txt → General text snippet (fallback)

README.md
Provides this overview and snippet counts.

File Type Detection

.cr → Crystal language snippets (class, def, module, require, etc.)

.yml → CI/CD or configuration files

Dockerfile → Docker container instructions

.sh → Shell commands or scripts

.sql → SQL queries

.txt → Generic fallback where language is unclear

Counts by Chapter

Chapter 00 (Intro/Preface): [if present, number of snippets]

Chapter 01: X snippets

Chapter 02: X snippets

…

Chapter N: X snippets

Total snippets: [overall count]

Notes

Extraction is heuristic-based. While most true code blocks are captured, a few may have been missed, and some text may have been included as code by mistake.

You may want to manually review the .txt snippets to determine if they belong to Crystal or another format.

This dataset is intended for study, experimentation, or reference alongside the main book.
